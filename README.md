# 24-7-365_Capstone
This is my front-end capstone project while attending Nashville Software School. I have built an interface for a streamlined business directory for products and services that are available 24 hours a day. The application uses Google Maps Javascript API, Angular Google Maps and Firebase for the back-end.

Key Goals:
1. Allow for a quick search of a business that is hard queried to only show results of business open at the time of the search.
2. Allow for users to get directions from their current location to the search result requested.
3. Allow for users to register priror to starting a search and leave a review of their interaction.

The application is still in beta testing and expected to be rolled out by 10/3/2016.
